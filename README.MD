### What is this repository?
This is a collection of code that I have either written in spare time when I was bored, programming assignments from classes, or simply an example program I made with the basics of a certain library for quick offline reference. I will be adding to this repo as time goes on.

### What programs are in here?
I tried to make the title of each file be self explanatory and each file also includes commenting (yay) to help everyone understand it a bit better. The programs I currently have loaded up here are:
- **Tower of Hanoi.py - ** This is a python program which solves the Towers of Hanoi puzzle by simulating each of the poles and shifting the rings between them until completed.
- **N Queens Puzzle.py - ** More commonly known as the "8 Queens Puzzle", this program allows you to generate and display every possible combination of queens on a chessboard that would not be a threat to each other. However, my program allows you to choose the number of queens by simply changing a single variable.
- **Dice Roll Simulator.py - ** A dice rolling program that allows the user to roll two "dice" (just a boring old psuedo-random number generator) as well as input the seed for the number generator.
- **Fractal Generator & Display.py - ** This python program generates five different fractals and displays them using Tkinter. The program begins by displaying a Sierpinski Triangle and then creates new ones using the same method but with four, five, six, and eight sides respectively. **WARNING:** I did NOT multithread this program AT ALL so running it will cause your CPU usage to spike.
- **Sort and Display.py - ** A program which allows input of an array which is then sorted using four different common sorting algorithms: Bubble, Optimized Bubble, Selection, and Insertion. Then, the number of comparisons and swaps for each algorithm is plotted on a bar graph to demonstrate efficiency.

I will hopefully be adding to this repository as I program more random and fun tidbits.
